This is the basis skeleton of the code that allows you to generate your own company profile. 

For it to actually generate something useful for an organization, the code needs to be slightly modified to
fit the organizations' PowerPoint template. It is currently modeled off a template found online that's in the file. However, it can be easily modified. 

If runner.py is run in terminal with the appropriate packages, then it'll trigger a user interface which accts for which company. For private companies, put in the company's name. For public companies,  enter the Yahoo Finance ticker and a full company profile will be generated.

Still updating; future updates will have information you can copy paste into the user interface which will appear summarized in the slide. Also looking into connecting this directly with Company's House and other free data providers.
